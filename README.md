# AthenaHacks - DiversiTea
## By Samantha Stone and Yasmine Nassar

Welcome to DiversiTea! Because we can never know what it's like to experience something
with different identities than the ones we hold, we created a space for people to share and read
stories from people who identify differently than we do. It's also a great tool to teach people
what intersectionality is and demonstrate how many identities can affect a given experience.

Here's how it works:
1. Post an experience you've had, and tag the identities you hold
OR
2. Search for stories of people with the identities you select (and explore different intersectionalities!)

## How to Run It
1. Click the link [here](firebaselinkhere)
2. Create an account if you haven't already, or sign in to an existing account.
3. Scroll through your timeline to view all stories submitted (of all tags).
4. Click tags to see stories within that specific category.
5. Click the search bar to search for a subset of tags.
6. Create your own post by clicking 'Write Post'. Don't forget to tag your identities!
